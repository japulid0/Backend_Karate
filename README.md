# Report Generated From Cucumber

To generate the Cucumber report what was done was to initially add the dependencies that in this case are cucumberUnit, CucumberJava and cucumber reporting, these dependencies were added in the dependencies section of the pom.

After that, a java class was created with the name ProjectReport where inside it a class was created for the report and another class where the created test cases will be executed.

To generate the report we will have to compile the Project Report class where the created test cases will be executed without inconvenience and in the Build folder the different execution reports will be generated, the user will be able to see them by a consolidated, by failures or each one independently, inside the overview.feature right click to open with Browser and choose Chrome and in this way the report generated by Cucumber from the executed cases can be validated.

The user will see the following report:

to review the generated report open the evidence in the following path.
